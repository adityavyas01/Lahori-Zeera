# **App Name**: Lahori Zeera Parallax

## Core Features:

- Scroll-Synced WebP Animation: Implements a full-screen background animation using WebP sequences synchronized with the user's scroll position for a cinematic effect, loading WebP sequences from URLs 'https://cpqpdylzdipzwmtwvknx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Zeera/frame_000_delay-0.04s.webp', 'https://cpqpdylzdipzwmtwvknx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Nimboo/frame_000_delay-0.04s.webp', and 'https://cpqpdylzdipzwmtwvknx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Shikanji/frame_000_delay-0.04s.webp'
- Flavor Variant Toggle: Allows users to toggle between three different Lahori Zeera flavors, updating the background WebP sequence and text content accordingly, transitioning using a fade-out/fade-in effect.
- Dynamic Text Overlay: Displays a header (flavor name), subtitle, and short description on the left side of the screen, which updates based on the selected flavor.
- Pre-loading with Progress: Pre-loads the WebP sequence for the selected flavor before revealing the hero section, showing a brand logo with a progress bar and percentage indicator during the loading process.
- CTA Buttons: Includes two rounded call-to-action buttons with customizable text and color schemes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Brown (#4B3621) for ZEERA, Yellow (#F4D03F) for NIMBOO, and Green (#2ECC71) for SHIKANJI to reflect each flavor's identity.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated shade of the primary flavor color; designed for a dark mode aesthetic.
- Accent color: A slightly less saturated hue, approximately 30 degrees counterclockwise from the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' for headlines (flavor names) and 'PT Sans' for body text (descriptions); Playfair is a serif and PT Sans a sans-serif.
- Single-page parallax design with a minimalist aesthetic to focus on the WebP animation and product presentation.
- Subtle fade-in/fade-out animations for text and image transitions when switching between flavors.
